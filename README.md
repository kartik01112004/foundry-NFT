# Non Fungible Token(ERC-721)

Eg: Pokemon

- Each card is unique
- Can't be replaced with another card
- Has its own attributes
- Can be bought/sold
- Can be stored in a wallet
- Can be transferred to another wallet
- Can be used in a game
  etc... etc..

## Semi-fungible token (ERC-1155)

## Difference b/w ERC20 and ERC721

ERC20 are simple, they simply map the amount of tokens to the address of the holder

721 have unique token ids these token ids have unique owner and they have a token URI

so each token is unique and represents a unique asset so as they are unique we need to difine the attributes of that unique asset just like a pokemon has differnt stats and a unique trainer which makes that unique
